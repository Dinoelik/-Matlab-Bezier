# -Matlab-Bezier
Bezier curve code.

This matlab code realases a calculation
 of Bezier curves Intersection points. 

Bezier curves may be of any order,
 i.e. determined by any number of points. 

The main goal is to view a very short code,
resolving such  uneasy problem. 

Realy the order of curves is limited by 
 inaccurasy of polynomial equation standart
 resolving method. 

Up to order 5 curves intersection obtained 
without any problem. But above 5 some 
intersection points may be lost.
